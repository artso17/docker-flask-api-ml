# Implementation of Machine Learning in RESTful API Flask Server in Docker Container 

## Project Brief
The Project aimed to test and gain my skills in Developing RESTful API using Flask Framework and implementing Machine Learning model in it that run on Docker container. The Project provided by Digital Skola. 

## Success Criteria
- Create prediction class that implement insurance prediction model in file `insurance_model.py`
- Create preprocessing class in file `insurance_pre.py`
- Create Flask server to route access and run prediction process in file `app.py`
- Run Flask server  in local machine and test API access using Postman
- Create `Dockerfile` to build flask server image
- Create `docker-compose.yml` to create container that connect to local directory
- Simulate API Prediction process

## Result
- Created prediction class that implement insurance prediction model in file `insurance_model.py`
- Created preprocessing class in file `insurance_pre.py`
- Created Flask server to route access and run prediction process in file `app.py`
- Run Flask server  in local machine and tested API access using Postman
- Created `Dockerfile` to build flask server image
- Created `docker-compose.yml` to create container that connect to local directory
- Simulated API Prediction process
